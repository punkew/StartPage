### New Tab Behaviour
Since [here](https://github.com/katalysatorn/MSEdge-StartPage/commit/46ebff255ac01fdd4392b46ce113bcd8fe56512c), I have made it so that the links open it in a new tab. I did this because you cannot set a new tab page to a file, so I wanted it to act as a 'Home' of sorts. You can remove this by:
1. Opening the `index.html` file in whatever folder your Start Page is in
2. Hit `Ctrl + H`
3. In **Find What:** type ` target="_blank"`
4. Hit **Replace All**
5. Save the file and it should now open in the current tab.

***Note:*** *These instructions are for Sublime Text 3 and may depend on what text editor you use*
